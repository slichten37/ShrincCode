003Dear Dr. Moore,004$
004Great work with Mr. Carter. You did a good job diagnosing the issue through your conversations with him and myself.005$
005He seems to be responding well enough to your prescribed treatment, and will hopefully be well enough to leave in a few short days.006$
006We appreciate your work, and as a 'thank-you', we've decided to add a couch to your office. Keep up the good work, and your office will be luxurious before you know it!007$
007Again, great job! I'll talk to you soon.008$
008Kind Regards, Dr. Grace
